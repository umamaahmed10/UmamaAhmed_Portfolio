### Data Scientist | Data Analyst 

>> Hello! Glad to see you here. This repository keeps track of my personal projects I have worked on. 

## About Me!
I am a motivated and enthusiastic individual who have strong interest in Data Science and Analytics. I am passionate about Visualizing and Analyzing Data and have developed proficiency in Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling. I believe the most expensive thing in this world is *Data*, from which I love building cool things! I completed my Masters in _Data Science_ from NED University of Engineering & Technology in March, 2023. The thrill of discovering insights from data to solve complex problems and visualize information provides me pride and satisfaction. I am seeking opportunities in the data science or analytics field. I am eager and excited to keep learning new methods in a challenging & fast-paced environment and, contribute in real-world challenges.

## Projects

### [SQL Server Project: Data Exploration of Covid’19 Deaths & Vaccinations](SQL_Covid_Project.sql)  
•	_**Software:** Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)_  
•	**Objective:** To get the insights of deaths and vaccinations in Covid’19.  
•	**Dataset:** The dataset is downloaded from _Our World In Data_ [website](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), which contains around 80,000 data values of people in all countries and continents in the world who died in Covid or get vaccinated.  
•	**Description**:  Exploring and analysing data by using SQL queries to get different insights such as,  
	How many cases are there in a particular country (say Canada) and how many deaths do they have.
	What percentage of population got Covid.  
	Countries with highest infection rate compared to population.  
	Countries with the highest death count per population.  
	Continents with the highest death count per population.  
	Death percentage across the world.  
	Total amount of people in the world that has been vaccinated.  
>>	**Skills:** SQL's Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types


### [Suicide Rates Overview 1960-2016 EDA](SuicideRatesOverviewEDA_Python.ipynb)
•	_**Software:** Jupyter Notebook (Python)_  
•	**Objective:**   
	Analyse the suicide rate of sex, the age groups and generation and plot the rank of suicide rate.  
	Understand the distribution of the suicide rate by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
	Analyse the key factors of high suicide rate.  
•	**Dataset:** The [dataset](SuicideRatesOverview_Dataset.csv) contains data from 100+ countries on the topic of suicide and mental health infrastructure. It was created by extracting the latest data from WHO and combining it into a single dataset.  This compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets linked by time and place, and was built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different states of United States (kaggle dataset).  
•	**Description:** Extracted data from csv file. Performed Data Pre-processing, Data Cleaning, Exploratory data analysis (EDA), Data Analysing and Insight Visualization through graphs and charts using Python and its libraries.  
•	**Output (Insights):**  
	No matter which year it is, the suicides number of male is about three times higher than of female.   
	The suicide rate is getting higher when the age is higher. That is, age is a factor of suicide.  
	Before 2000, we can see that the highest suicide rate is 'G.I. generation', They suffered from the worldwide great depression before WW2, at this time, the income, profit, taxes are decreased seriously, so this generation experienced economic and social turmoil.  
	Interestingly, the suicide rate of Generation X and Millenials increase step by step, the suicide rate increases rapidly once the average age of generation is over 20. Does it mean that the suicide rate of young person’s rise when they are independent of their parents? In other words, healthy family is helpful to the suicide rate. 
	According to the suicide rate of each level of age, the rate of elderly is higher, so young people should care more about the elderly. Moreover, the country welfare of the elderly may also impact the rate.  
>>	**Skills:** Python Programming (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, plotnine, seaborn), Data Extraction, Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data Visualization.  


### [Login Form using Python Flask Framework](https://github.com/umamaahmed10/PythonLoginForm.git)

•	**Description:** Created a Flask web with 3 routes (login, signup & movies), login would accept both GET and POST request methods. Login page with login form has two options username and password while POST request is used to perform login itself.  Signup form have five options email, first name, last name, username and password and stores user data in SQLite database. In case of successful login, movies list is shown to the user in form of HTML table with 3 columns of Rank & Title, Year & IMDb Rating.
