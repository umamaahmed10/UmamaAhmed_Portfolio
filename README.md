### Data Analyst  

>> Hello! Glad to see you here. This repository keeps track of my personal projects I have worked on. 

## About Me!
I am a Data Analyst and passionate about Analysing and Visualizing Data as said, _A picture says more than a thousand words_. I believe the most expensive thing in this world is *Data*. I completed my Masters in _Data Science_ from NED University of Engineering & Technology in Feb, 2023. The thrill of discovering insights from data to solve complex problems and visualize data provides me pride and satisfaction. I am eager to continuously advance my skills and learn new technologies and bring my technical skills into the field of Data Specialization.

•	**Output:** Dashboard that shows visualization of,  
	Average Income per purchase (Males who purchased bike has high income than of Females who purchased bike)  
	Customer Age Range (Middle aged people are likely to purchase more bike as compared to old and young.)  
	Customer Commute (how much the distance matters for purchasing a bike)

### [Call Center Budget Analysis]()
•	_Software: Microsoft Excel_  
•	**Objective:** Examine the budget of the call centre and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.  
•	**Dataset:** The dataset is downloaded from ‘Real World Fake Data’ [dataworld](https://data.world/login?next=%2Fmarkbradbourne%2Frwfd-real-world-fake-data%2Fworkspace%2Ffile%3Ffilename%3DCall%2BCenter.csv). This call-center dataset has over 32,900 records of data that describes calls made to various call centres. It includes the ID of the call and many other attributes.  
•	**Description:** Performed data sorting & cleaning. Filtered data according to the requirements, extracted date as a number out of dates, and created pivot tables and visualization charts.  
•	**Output:**

	Line Chart (trend of calls during October)  
	Doughnut Chart (through which channel the call was made)  
	Column Chart (reason the person called)  
	Bar Chart (indication the response time)  
>> **Skills:** Cleaning & Transforming data, Managing data, Pivot tables with Slicers, VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP, Data Formatting (date, time, arrays), Interactive Dashboard.

  


### [Data Specialist Survey Breakdown]()
•	_Software: Microsoft Power BI_  
•	**Objective:** To determine the average salary and various aspects of a particular job of Data Specialists.
•	**Dataset:** The non- integrated data is collected through a survey from 5 countries asking different question about their Job, Salary, Gender, Age, and Happiness with Work/Life balance.  
•	**Description:** Cleaned and Sorted the data by removing duplicates, misspell, identifying incorrect values & transforming the data using Microsoft Power BI, split columns, Power query, formatting data types to create different charts to analyse data.  
•	**Output:** A Power BI report that shows according to the Survey,  
	The average salary in United State of Data Analyst is $80,000.  
	On Average people are 5.7% happy with their work-life balance and 4.2% happy with their salary.

### [Suicide Rates Overview 1960-2016 EDA]()
•	_Software: Jupyter Notebook (Python)_  
•	**Objective:**   
	Analyse the suicide rate of sex, the age groups and generation and plot the rank of suicide rate.  
	Understand the distribution of the suicide rate by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
	Analyse the key factors of high suicide rate.  
•	**Dataset:** The [dataset]() contains data from 100+ countries on the topic of suicide and mental health infrastructure. It was created by extracting the latest data from WHO and combining it into a single dataset.  This compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets linked by time and place, and was built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different states of United States (kaggle dataset).  
•	**Description:** Extracted data from csv file. Performed Data Pre-processing, Data Cleaning, Exploratory data analysis (EDA), Data Analysing and Insight Visualization through graphs and charts using Python and its libraries.  
•	**Output (Insights):**  
	No matter which year it is, the suicides number of male is about three times higher than of female.   
	The suicide rate is getting higher when the age is higher. That is, age is a factor of suicide.  
	Before 2000, we can see that the highest suicide rate is 'G.I. generation', They suffered from the worldwide great depression before WW2, at this time, the income, profit, taxes are decreased seriously, so this generation experienced economic and social turmoil.  
	Interestingly, the suicide rate of Generation X and Millenials increase step by step, the suicide rate increases rapidly once the average age of generation is over 20. Does it mean that the suicide rate of young person’s rise when they are independent of their parents? In other words, healthy family is helpful to the suicide rate. 
	According to the suicide rate of each level of age, the rate of elderly is higher, so young people should care more about the elderly. Moreover, the country welfare of the elderly may also impact the rate.  
>>	**Skills:** Python Programming (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, plotnine, seaborn), Data Extraction, Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data Visualization.  


### [Login Form using Python Flask Framework]()
•	_Software: Visual Studio Code_  
•	**Goal:** Create a Python Flask Application using Beautiful Soup, Selenium, VS Code and other tools by performing the tasks in following order.  
•	**Dataset**: Extracted data of top rated movies from IMDb using this URL _https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/_ and save it in a CSV file.  
•	**Description:** Created a Flask web with 3 routes (login, signup & movies), login would accept both GET and POST request methods. Login page with login form has two options username and password while POST request is used to perform login itself.  Signup form have five options email, first name, last name, username and password and stores user data in SQLite database. In case of successful login, movies list is shown to the user in form of HTML table with 3 columns of Rank & Title, Year & IMDb Rating.  
>>	**Skills:** Python Programming, Flask Framework, Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Excel, VS Code and other tools.
